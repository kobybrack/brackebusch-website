This is a Next.js project I made to create a blog. Instead of doing static posts, they are stored in a database. Images are stored in Vercel Blob.

On the current roadmap:
* better styling/quality of life upgrades
* unit tests...
* some fun pages like "favorite music/hobby right now" or equivalent
* post editor (account protected)
* comments
* accounts
* comment replies
* emails for comments/comment replies
* guest posts

This project is a lot of fun. I love easy to use Vercel is
