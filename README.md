This is a Next.js project I made to create a blog. Instead of doing static posts, they are stored in a database. Images are stored in Vercel Blob.

On the current roadmap:
* better styling/quality of life upgrades
  * better mobile nav bar
  * next/previous post buttons at bottom of page
  * other things Kiden will help me with
  * new favicon
* images
* fill out home/about pages 
* unit tests...
* paginating posts page
* some fun pages like "favorite music/hobby right now" or equivalent
* search posts
* post editor (password protected)
* comments
* accounts (Oauth?)
* comment replies
* emails for comments/comment replies
* guest posts
