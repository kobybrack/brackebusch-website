This is a Next.js project I made to create a blog. Instead of doing static posts, they are stored in a database. Images are stored in Vercel Blob.

On the current roadmap:

- fill out home/about pages
- search posts
- post editor (password protected)
- unit tests...
- some fun pages like "favorite music/hobby right now" or equivalent
- accounts (Oauth?)
- comments
- comment replies
- emails for comments/comment replies
- guest posts
- post tags
