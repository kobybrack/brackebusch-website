                    My name is Koby Chase Brackebusch. My two favorite things are Jesus and my wife Kiden. I would
                    describe myself as zealous. I get very passionate about everything that enters my life. This website
                    is a way for me to post about my passions. My hope is that I can convey myself in a way that is
                    enticing and draws people in to the things that I love. Here are some random things about me:
                </p>

                    <li>I work as a software engineer</li>

                    <li>I have ADHD, which is apparently not surprising to some</li>
                </ul>

                    This is a NextJs project hosted by Vercel. All of the content for the website is stored in a Neon
                    database and the Images are stored in Vercel Blob. I am making continual upgrades, check them out on
                    my GitHub: https://github.com/kobybrack/brackebusch-website.

                <h2 className="mt-0">Jesus</h2>
                <p>
                    Jesus saved my life. He is the son of God. Because of his great love for us, he humbled himself and
                    became human for our sake. He lived a perfect life 2000 years ago, and was crucified under Pontius
                    Pilate. In his crucifixion, more than just the physical pain he endured, he willingly took on the
                    punishment of all of the evil in this world. All of the evil that we've done, are doing, and will
                    do. He atoned for all of our sins, so we could live in right relationship with God, which is eternal
                    life. This forgiveness of sins is open to anyone who surrenders their life to God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only did he bear the punishment, he also rose from the dead! By this, we know his message is
                    true. He defeated evil, and established a new kingdom on this earth. Those who choose to follow
                    Jesus are filled with the Holy Spirit of God, the same power that rose Jesus from the dead. The Holy
                    Spirit makes us more and more like Jesus, day by day. He empowers us to love others and perform
                    supernatural works to further establish the kingdom of God - one of love, joy, peace, patience,
                    kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there are still evils in this world, one day, Jesus will come back, and fully redeem
                    everything that has been broken, and create a new heaven and earth. We will live forever united with
                    him. It will be a place where there are no tears, no sickness, no pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have not given your life to Jesus, just know a truly fulfilling life is waiting for you. The
                    God of the universe loves you so deeply, and desires a relationship with you. The offer is always
                    there.
