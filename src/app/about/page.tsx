                    My name is Koby Chase Brackebusch. My two favorite things are <strong>Jesus</strong> and my wife
                    Kiden. I would describe myself as zealous. I get very passionate about everything that enters my
                    life. This website is a way for me to post about my passions. My hope is that I can convey myself in
                    a way that is enticing and draws people in to the things that I love. Here are some random things
                    about me:

                    <li>
                        I grew up in Duvall, Washington, in a <em>very large</em> family
                    </li>
                    <li>I love music so much, which has led me to learning a lot of instruments</li>
                    <li>I work as a software engineer</li>
                    <li>I'm 5'8"</li>
                    <li>I have ADHD, which is apparently not surprising to some</li>
                </ul>
